# **A Parallelized Probabilistic B-Tree** Variant Written in **Rust**

---

## An extremely fast and space-efficient data-structure to tackle massive databases.

---

Introducing an enhanced B-Tree data structure designed for unparalleled speed and efficiency in large databases. 
By integrating an innovative parallelized probabilistic data structure within its nodes, this advanced B-Tree variant significantly 
outperforms the traditional B-Tree. This cutting-edge implementation is optimized for massive databases, prioritizing rapid 
lookups over retrievals, making it the ideal choice for high-performance data-intensive applications.

**Features:**

- An extremely space-efficient data structure 
designed for massive databases
- Written as modular functions to be integrated seemelessly
into any project running in production.
- Guranteed speed improvements and highly optimized for 
look-up operations within databases.
- One of the most space/memory efficient data structures
to exist.
- Parallelized and multithreaded to improve run-time complexity
off the paper.
- Works out of the box for almost every project.

**How to use:**

Simply set up your existing project up to use this data structure in place of
your existing data structures and run your code as normal.

```
cargo run
```
